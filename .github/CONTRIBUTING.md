# Contributing to the Project

Hey there! You seem to be interested in contributing to the Project. And that's cool!
Just be sure to read the Contribution Guidelines before doing that!
If you follow the Guidelines, you will probably help me respond faster, so follow the guidelines

## Guidelines

- Describe the Feature or Bug Fix you're adding as detailed as you can. This does not mean you should include definitions for every word you use.
- Only contribute Code you think could be helpful for someone else. If you need a feature that has a very specific usecase, dont request or contribute it to the main project. Just clone or Fork the Repository and add the feature to your modified Bot.
- Always label your Pull Requests. If you don't know which label you should choose, try to look at the small explanation below the label and choose a label with the additional Info.
- If you're fixing a bug, dont forget to mention the original issue
