# phx-bot
The Discord Bot for the PHX discord server

# Use of the Bot
The Bot is for my own private use on the PHX discord server, and will probably include code that is only useful in my specific usecase.
In some usecases my code will be reusable or able to be modified to be reusable, and for this case, i've created this public repository.
I wont be aiming for reusable code, as this is a "private" project, but you're free to try and improve my code by opening a Pull Request
